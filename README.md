Research Engagement Toolkit for Community Healthcare Providers
Overview
This toolkit has been developed to support clinicians and research delivery staff at Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust (CLCH) and other community healthcare providers who are initiating their involvement in clinical research.

It is designed to provide practical, easy-to-use resources for setting up and delivering clinical trials in community settings, including projects involving vulnerable populations such as those living with dementia or learning disabilities.

The toolkit is structured as a decision tree to help guide users through each stage of the research delivery pathway — from project initiation to study close-down — and can be adapted for use across a wide range of study types.

Key Features
✅ Practical decision tree to navigate research delivery
✅ Step-by-step guidance for clinicians new to research
✅ Templates, tools and checklists covering the entire project lifecycle
✅ Focused on clinical trials in community healthcare settings
✅ Aligned with UK regulatory and governance frameworks (e.g. HRA, NIHR CPMS, EDGE)
